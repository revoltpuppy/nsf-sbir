      For 40 years, America’s Seed Fund (powered by NSF) has helped startups transform their ideas into marketable products. We focus on the highest-risk technologies &mdash; those that show promise but whose success hasn’t yet been validated &mdash; and each year, we award nearly $190 million in funding to entrepreneurs across the country.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>$225,000 in funding: </strong> We award up to $225,000 in funding (over six to 12 months) for R&D work. We’ll also provide you with training and mentorship in key business areas.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>0% equity: </strong> You retain full ownership over your company and intellectual property. And because our awards aren’t loans, there’s nothing to pay back.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Major social impact: </strong> We don't have the same financial incentives as most investors, so we can make <a href="#">impact investments</a> that may take longer to provide a financial return. Our goal is to invest in a better future for our shareholders: the American public.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Minimal standard reporting: </strong> We provide templates for reporting monthly progress and financials. No need to waste time crafting decks and building spreadsheets — we help you focus on building your product instead.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Virtual consults with program advisors: </strong> We promote startups in all locations, not just tech hubs. You don’t need to relocate to gain access to our funding or mentors.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Possible follow-on funding: </strong> Companies that complete Phase I may be eligible for more funding. If you’ve shown that your technology is feasible and needs more development, you could receive an additional $750,000 over two years.

    <h4 class="sidebar">Program basics</h4>
    <p>
      We offer two funding tracks: SBIR and STTR. If you’re partnering with another research institution, the STTR track is best for you. Otherwise, apply using the SBIR track.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you decide to apply for funding, you’ll submit a Phase I proposal for up to $225,000, which will cover six to twelve months of work (your project’s duration is determined by what you’re researching). You’ll find out whether your proposal was accepted or declined within four to six months of the proposal deadline.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re awarded Phase I funding, you’ll be expected to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Continue exploring the product-market fit you’ve identified
      </li>
      <li>
        Determine your technology’s feasibility
      </li>
      <li>
        Design and test prototypes
      </li>
      <li>
        Identify any relevant legal or regulatory issues
      </li>
      <li>
        Develop a plan to scale your technology
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your funding can cover your employees’ salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, and other R&amp;D costs. You can’t use funding for business development or marketing work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Founders often ask whether they can update their research plan during the course of a project, and the answer is yes — with a few stipulations. While it’s OK for you to update your business model or R&D strategy a bit (this is bound to happen), you can’t entirely shift the focus of your work.

    <h4 class="sidebar">We support small companies and new entrepreneurs</h4>
    <p>
      We work with startups and small businesses (500 or fewer employees, including affiliates). We welcome proposals from newly formed companies — you don’t need a track record of commercialization to apply for funding — but please note that your company needs to be a legal entity before you apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your company is majority owned by a venture capital operating company, hedge fund, or private-equity firm, you’re not eligible to apply for funding, although joint ventures and partnerships are eligible. Read more about proposal eligibility in our <a href="#">Eligibility Guide</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each company can submit only one proposal per solicitation period.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="container">
    <h4 class="sidebar">We support R&amp;D with lots of technical risk</h4>
    <p>
      Our seed funding is for R&amp;D that involves a good amount of technical risk. If you’re already sure that your product is technically feasible, this program isn’t a good fit for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      In selected cases, we support innovations to existing products, but these innovations must dramatically change the products’ commercial outcomes. We don’t fund work that simply improves existing products.
